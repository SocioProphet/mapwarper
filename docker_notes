docker notes
==========


Use Docker Compose to run Rails, Postgis and Redis
===================

First, copy config/application.yml config/secrets.yml and config/database.yml from their non example files

#build everything
docker-compose build  

#create the new db and run migrations
docker-compose run web rake db:create db:migrate  

#Add super user (Make a note of the password, the email is super@example.com)

docker-compose run web rake warper:create_superuser

#or do it the long way around manually
docker exec -it mapwarper_web_1 /bin/bash
bundle exec rake warper:superuser


#Run everything
docker-compose up

connect to localhost:3000 in your browser

Configuration
=========
copy the .env.example file to .env and configure it

----

development
============

docker-compose is set up for production but you can use it in development by passing in the build arg and setting the correct environment variables

docker-compose build  --build-arg RAILS_ENV_ARG=development web

and then making sure in your .env file that these are set to development too and changing the database 
RAILS_ENV=development
RACK_ENV=development
